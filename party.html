        <h2>Party demographics</h2>

        <br>

        <p>The ASUC is currently made up of two dominant political parties, Student Action and CalSERVE. While Student Action has traditionally represented the Greek, engineering and Jewish communities, the party’s 2013-14 senate class also included representatives of the Muslim, Vietnamese pre-health and undocumented student populations &mdash; among others &mdash; reflecting the party’s effort to expand their constituency over the past few years. CalSERVE, a progressive campus political party, has typically aligned itself with underrepresented groups, including the Chicano and queer communities, and has expanded its representation in recent years to include transfer and re-entry students, as well as student parents. SQUELCH!, a traditionally satirical party that has slated several serious candidates over the last three years, has recently emerged as the most prominent challenge to the ASUC’s largely two-party system.</p> 

        <p>Our survey asked respondents to provide demographic information including gender, political affiliation, race, religion, identification as LGBTIQQA, identification as a first-generation student, participation in Greek life and/or the Berkeley Student Cooperative. The breakdowns for the three main ASUC political parties by each demographic are below. </p>

        <h4><a href="survey.html#Q3-1" target="_blank">Q3.1</a> &nbsp; No matter how you voted in this election, do you usually identify with:</h4>
        <br>
    </div>


    <div class="col-md-5 vdown"><h5>Gender</h5><p>While our results showed that women represented the majority of each party’s constituency, respondents who identified with Student Action were more likely to be male than supporters of any other party. In contrast, 64 percent of respondents who identified as CalSERVE also identified as female.</p></div>
    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1"><div id="Q3-1-gender"></div></div>


    <div class="col-md-5 vdown" id="political"><h5>Political affiliation</h5><p>Student Action’s constituency comprised mostly of liberal and moderate students while CalSERVE’s supporters were made up of mostly very liberal and liberal students. No respondent who identified as conservative identified with CalSERVE and very few students who said they were very liberal – only six – were affiliated with Student Action.</p></div>
    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1"><div id="Q3-1-political"></div></div>

    
    <div class="col-md-5 vdown" id="race"><h5>Race</h5><p>In terms of race, all three parties’ largest constituency was white students. SQUELCH!’s supporters had the largest proportion of white students – 66 percent – followed by Student Action at 46 percent and CalSERVE at 34 percent. Respondents who did not identify with a political party were also more likely to identify with a race other than White, East Asian, South Asian or Hispanic.</p></div>
    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1"><div id="Q3-1-race"></div></div>

    <div class="col-md-5 vdown" id="religion"><h5>Religion</h5><p>Although Student Action’s candidates and constituency have typically included representatives of the Jewish community, the party had the same share of Jewish supporters – 11 percent – as CalSERVE, while 21 percent of SQUELCH!’s constituency identified as Jewish. Respondents who identified as Christian or atheist were distributed fairly evenly across the parties.</p></div>
    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1"><div id="Q3-1-religion"></div></div>

    <div class="col-md-5 vdown" id="lgbt"><h5>LQBTIQQA</h5><p>CalSERVE’s supporters had the highest percentage of students who identified as LGBTIQQA at 25 percent, in contrast with Student Action’s supporters, whose constituency was only 3 percent LGBTIQQA. SQUELCH’s proportion of LGBTIQQA students matched the percentage of overall respondents at 15 percent.</p></div>
    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1"><div id="Q3-1-lgbt"></div></div>
    
    <div class="col-md-5 vdown" id="income"><h5>Income</h5><p>CalSERVE’s constituency had the highest percentage of students who reported family incomes in the lowest bracket while Student Action’s constituency had the largest ratio of respondents who reported incomes from the highest bracket. The financial makeup of SQUELCH’s constituency lay somewhere in the middle, with the highest percentage of students who reported family incomes in the middle bracket.</p></div>
    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1"><div id="Q3-1-income"></div></div>

    <div class="col-md-5 vdown" id="firstgen"><h5>First-generation</h5><p>Respondents who identified as first-generation college students – students who are first in their immediate family to attend college – comprised 21 percent of our survey respondents. CalSERVE’s constituency was made up of 26 percent of these students, while SQUELCH!’s and Student Action’s supporters comprised of 17 and 13 percent respectively.</p></div>
    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1"><div id="Q3-1-firstgen"></div></div>

    <div class="col-md-5 vdown" id="greek"><h5>Greek life</h5><p>While only 21 percent of respondents said they are involved with a social fraternity or sorority, 43 percent of Student Action’s constituency and 36 percent of SQUELCH’s constituency were affiliated with one of these organizations. Members of the Greek community comprised only 13 percent of respondents who identified with CalSERVE.</p></div>
    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1"><div id="Q3-1-greek"></div></div>

    <div class="col-md-5 vdown" id="bsc"><h5>Berkeley Student Cooperative</h5><p>CalSERVE often aligns itself with the Cooperative Movement Party, a third party that represents the Berkeley Student Cooperative. However SQUELCH! had the highest proportion of BSC members in their constituency, with 15 percent of its supporters reporting BSC membership. CalSERVE was close behind, with 13 percent and Student Action had the lowest percentage – only 2 percent – of BSC members among its supporters.</p></div>

    <div class="col-md-5 vdown" id="bsc"><h5>Major</h5><p>CalSERVE often aligns itself with the Cooperative Movement Party, a third party that represents the Berkeley Student Cooperative. However SQUELCH! had the highest proportion of BSC members in their constituency, with 15 percent of its supporters reporting BSC membership.
