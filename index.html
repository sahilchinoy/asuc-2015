        <h2>Party demographics</h2>

        <br>

        <p>The ASUC is currently made up of two dominant political parties, Student Action and CalSERVE. While Student Action has traditionally represented the Greek, engineering and Jewish communities, the party’s 2013-14 senate class also included representatives of the Muslim, Vietnamese pre-health and undocumented student populations – among others – reflecting the party’s effort to expand their constituency over the past few years. CalSERVE, a progressive campus political party, has typically aligned itself with underrepresented groups, including the Chicano and queer communities, and has . SQUELCH!, a traditionally satirical party that has slated several serious candidates over the last three years, has recently emerged as the most prominent challenge to the ASUC’s largely two-party system.</p> 

        <p>Our survey asked respondents to provide demographic information including gender, race, religion, family income, political affiliation and sexuality. The breakdowns for the three main ASUC political parties by each demographic are below.</p>
