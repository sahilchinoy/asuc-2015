        <h2>Party demographics</h2>

        <br>

        <p>The ASUC is currently made up of two dominant political parties, Student Action and CalSERVE. While Student Action has traditionally represented the Greek, engineering and Jewish communities, the party’s 2013-14 senate class also included representatives of the Muslim, Vietnamese pre-health and undocumented student populations – among others – reflecting the party’s effort to expand their constituency over the past few years. CalSERVE, a progressive campus political party, has typically aligned itself with underrepresented groups, including the Chicano and queer communities, and has expanded its representation in recent years to include transfer and re-entry students, as well as student parents. SQUELCH!, a traditionally satirical party that has slated several serious candidates over the last three years, has recently emerged as the most prominent challenge to the ASUC’s largely two-party system.</p> 

        <p>Our survey asked respondents to provide demographic information including gender, political affiliation, race, religion, identification as LGBTIQQA, identification as a first-generation student, participation in Greek life and/or the Berkeley Student Cooperative. The breakdowns for the three main ASUC political parties by each demographic are below. </p>
