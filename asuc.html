        <h2>ASUC approval</h2>
        <p>Each academic year sees a new set of ASUC executives and senators, providing each new student government with the opportunity to prioritize initiatives different from those of their predecessors.</p>

        <p>Candidates sometimes have very ambitious platforms — none more ambitious than SQUELCH! satirical presidential candidate Jake “The First” Fineman’s <a href="http://www.dailycal.org/2015/04/02/self-proclaimed-rightful-heir-campus-throne-jake-first-fineman-runs-asuc-president/" target="_blank">plan</a> to abolish the student government entirely in favor of a feudal system. Most candidates, however, are serious about their goals, and we wanted to find out if voters believe in their representatives’ abilities to follow through on these promises.</p> 
        <p>The ASUC Senate votes on measures related to student life, in addition to issues of national and international concern. We tried to gauge whether students think the current ASUC focuses too much on one area at the expense of the other.</p>

        <p>We were also interested in the student body’s trust in their elected representatives. This page presents our findings related to voters’ trust and approval of their student government.</p>
